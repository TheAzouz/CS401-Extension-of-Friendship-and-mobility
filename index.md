## III) Checkin pattern between friends:
In this part, we seek to finding some meeting patterns between friends. We say two friends have met if they checked in the same place with at most one hour difference.  
We will do three tasks in this part : Firstly, we will try to find the distribution of checkins as a function of the distance from home and compare two cases : case where users checkin with a friend a the general case where users check in not taking into account friends.
Secondly, we will try to find place checkin patterns : we will study the places where friends meet, and how likely some friends are to meet in a certain place depending on the whether it s a work day or week end day. Finally, we will study the distribution of checkins in places depending on the time of the day (day or night).
### 1) Checkin patterns and ditribution :
We begin by getting the probability of distribution for two different datasets : dataset where we take into account all the checkins and dataset where we only study checkins made with friends. 
In both cases, we only study users who checked in at least once in their homes and assume their home is located at the average of checkins labeled with home `Home (private)`. 
We plot (loglog) the distribution for both datasets as a function from the distance from home and try to describe the case where a user only moves to meet friends with a function of the type : $ax^b$
